	abstract = {We introduce a new approach to realize incrementally verifiable computation (IVC), in which the prover recursively proves the correct execution of incremental computations of the form \$\$y=F{\textasciicircum}\{({\textbackslash}ell )\}(x)\$\$y=F(ℓ)(x), where F is a (potentially non-deterministic) computation, x is the input, y is the output, and \$\${\textbackslash}ell {\textgreater} 0\$\$ℓ{\textgreater}0. Unlike prior approaches to realize IVC, our approach avoids succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) entirely and arguments of knowledge in general. Instead, we introduce and employ folding schemes, a weaker, simpler, and more efficiently-realizable primitive, which reduces the task of checking two instances in some relation to the task of checking a single instance. We construct a folding scheme for a characterization of NP and show that it implies an IVC scheme with improved efficiency characteristics: (1) the “recursion overhead” (i.e., the number of steps that the prover proves in addition to proving the execution of F) is a constant and it is dominated by two group scalar multiplications expressed as a circuit (this is the smallest recursion overhead in the literature), and (2) the prover’s work at each step is dominated by two multiexponentiations of size O({\textbar}F{\textbar}), providing the fastest prover in the literature. The size of a proof is O({\textbar}F{\textbar}) group elements, but we show that using a variant of an existing zkSNARK, the prover can prove the knowledge of a valid proof succinctly and in zero-knowledge with \$\$O({\textbackslash}log \{{\textbar}F{\textbar}\})\$\$O(log{\textbar}F{\textbar})group elements. Finally, our approach neither requires a trusted setup nor FFTs, so it can be instantiated efficiently with any cycles of elliptic curves where DLOG is hard.},

Although some BFL frameworks are considered privacy-preserving, they are still vulnerable to various attacks, including inference and model poisoning. Additionally, most of these solutions employ strong trust assumptions among all participating entities or introduce incentive mechanisms to encourage collaboration, making them susceptible to multiple security flaws. This work presents VerifBFL, a trustless, privacy-preserving, and verifiable federated learning framework that integrates blockchain technology and cryptographic protocols. By employing zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) and incrementally verifiable computation (IVC), VerifBFL ensures the verifiability of both local training and aggregation processes. The proofs of training and aggregation are verified on-chain, guaranteeing the integrity and auditability of each participant's contributions. To protect training data from inference attacks, VerifBFL leverages differential privacy. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocols, we built a proof of concept using emerging tools. The results show that generating proofs for local training and aggregation in VerifBFL takes less than 81s and 2s, respectively, while verifying them on-chain takes less than 0.6s.},

ZKPs have unique advantages in terms of universality and minimal security assumptions when compared to other privacy-sensitive computational methods for distributed systems, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. Their application spans multiple domains, from enhancing privacy in blockchain to facilitating confidential verification of computational tasks. This survey starts with a high-level overview of the technical workings of ZKPs with a focus on an increasingly relevant subset of ZKPs called zk-SNARKS. While there have been prior surveys on the algorithmic and theoretical aspects of ZKPs, our work is distinguished by providing a broader view of practical aspects and describing many recently-developed use cases of ZKPs across various domains. These application domains span blockchain privacy, scaling, storage, and interoperability, as well as non-blockchain applications like voting, authentication, timelocks, and machine learning. Aimed at both practitioners and researchers, the survey also covers foundational components and infrastructure such as zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVM), domain-specific languages (DSLs), supporting libraries, frameworks, and protocols. We conclude with a discussion on future directions, positioning ZKPs as pivotal in the advancement of cryptographic practices and digital privacy across many applications.},

	abstract = {Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic primitives, where information between a prover and a verifier can be authenticated by the prover, without revealing any of the specific information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This makes direct communication between the prover and verifier unnecessary, effectively removing any intermediaries.
The key advantage of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs is that they can be used in situations where there is no possibility of interaction between the prover and verifier, such as in online transactions where the two parties are not able to communicate in real time. This makes non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs particularly useful in decentralized systems like blockchains, where transactions are verified by a network of nodes and there is no central authority to oversee the verification process.
Most non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs are based on mathematical constructs like elliptic curve cryptography or pairing-based cryptography, which allow for the creation of short and easily verifiable proofs of the truth of a statement. Unlike interactive zero-knowledge proofs, which require multiple rounds of interaction between the prover and verifier, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs are designed to be efficient and can be used to verify a large number of statements simultaneously.},

	abstract = {In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof (also known as a ZK proof or ZKP) is a protocol in which one party (the prover) can convince another party (the verifier) that some given statement is true, without conveying to the verifier any information beyond the mere fact of that statement's truth. The intuition underlying zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove possession of the relevant information simply by revealing it; the hard part is to prove this possession without revealing this information (or any aspect of it whatsoever).
In light of the fact that one should be able to generate a proof of some statement only when in possession of certain secret information connected to the statement, the verifier, even after having become convinced of the statement's truth, should nonetheless remain unable to prove the statement to further third parties.
Zero-knowledge proofs can be interactive, meaning that the prover and verifier exchange messages according to some protocol, or noninteractive, meaning that the verifier is convinced by a single prover message and no other communication is needed. In the standard model, interaction is required, except for trivial proofs of BPP problems. In the common random string and random oracle models, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs exist. The Fiat–Shamir heuristic can be used to transform certain interactive zero-knowledge proofs into noninteractive ones.},

Unfortunately, the ability of these devices to sense and share various physical parameters, although play a key role in these smart systems but also causes the threat of breach of the privacy of the users. Existing solutions for privacy-preserving computation for decentralized systems either use too complex cryptographic techniques or exploit an extremely high degree of message passing and hence, are not suitable for the resource-constrained IoT devices that constitute a significant fraction of a smart system. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight strategy LiPI for Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation in low-power IoT systems. The design of the strategy is based on decentralized and collaborative data obfuscation and does not exploit any dependency on any trusted third party. In addition, besides minimizing the communication requirements, we make appropriate use of the recent advances in Synchronous-Transmission (ST)-based protocols in our design to accomplish the goal efficiently. Extensive evaluation based on comprehensive experiments in both simulation platforms and publicly available WSN/IoT testbeds demonstrates that our strategy works up to at least 51.7\% faster and consumes 50.5\% lesser energy compared to the existing state-of-the-art strategies.},

Since IoT has many application areas including smart home, smart grids, smart healthcare system, smart and intelligent transportation and many more. Most of these applications are fueled by the resource-constrained sensor network, such as Smart healthcare system is powered by Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Smart home and weather monitoring systems are fueled by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In the mentioned application areas sensor node life is a very important aspect of these technologies as it explicitly effects the network life and performance. Data aggregation techniques are used to increase sensor node life by decreasing communication overhead. However, when the data is aggregated at intermediate nodes to reduce communication overhead, data privacy problems becomes more vulnerable. Different Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation (PPDA) techniques have been proposed to ensure data privacy during data aggregation in resource-constrained sensor nodes. We provide a review and comparative analysis of the state of the art PPDA techniques in this paper. The comparative analysis is based on Computation Cost, Communication overhead, Privacy Level, resistance against malicious aggregator, sensor node life and energy consumption by the sensor node. We have studied the most recent techniques and provide in-depth analysis of the minute steps involved in these techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most recent and comprehensive study of PPDA techniques.},

We start by introducing the notion of recursive composition of SNARKs, before introducing Zecale as a privacy preserving scalability solution.

Finally, we argue that such scalability solutions for privacy preserving state transitions are paramount to emulate "cash" on blockchain systems.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of blockchain has significantly promoted research on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), especially zero-knowledge succinct noninteractive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARK). As is well known, protocol proof and verification time, as well as proof size, are the main obstacles that restrict the implementation of ZKPs in practical applications, so they have become the main concerns of researchers in recent years. This work achieves a new recursive zk-SNARK called GENES, which does not have a trusted setup and is secure under the standard discrete logarithm assumption. GENES is designed from the form of the rank-1 constraint system (R1CS) satisfiability problem. Recursive proof composition is achieved by merging multiple R1CS instances, which transforms the verification of numerous proofs into the verification of a single proof. Moreover, multi-helpers amortize proof commitments in this study, significantly reducing the computational pressure and time cost of proof generation. Compared with previous work, GENES effectively improves the proof time and verification time, but at the cost of larger proof sizes. We provide a blockchain Layer-1 scaling solution leveraging GENES to demonstrate its practicality.},

We evaluated performance across four general-purpose programming libraries and two programming languages. Our results show that zk-SNARK produced the smallest proofs, while zk-STARK generated the largest. In terms of proof generation and verification times, zk-STARK was the fastest, and Bulletproof was the slowest. Interestingly, zk-SNARK proofs verified marginally faster than zk-STARK, contrary to other findings. These insights enhance our understanding of the functionality, security, and performance of NIZKP protocols, providing valuable guidance for selecting the most suitable protocol for specific applications.},

Traditional approaches often rely on third parties, while blockchain-based solutions face computational and storage bottlenecks. Our novel framework employs edge aggregating servers and Ethereum Layer 2 rollups, offering a scalable and secure IoT data authentication solution that reduces the need for continuous, direct interaction between IoT devices and the blockchain. We utilize and compare the Nova and Risc0 proving systems for authenticating batches of IoT data by verifying signatures, ensuring data integrity and privacy. Notably, the Nova prover significantly outperforms Risc0 in proving and verification times; for instance, with 10 signatures, Nova takes 3.62 s compared to Risc0’s 369 s, with this performance gap widening as the number of signatures in a batch increases. Our framework further enhances data verifiability and trust by recording essential information on L2 rollups, creating an immutable and transparent record of authentication. The use of Layer 2 rollups atop a permissionless blockchain like Ethereum effectively reduces on-chain storage costs by approximately 48 to 57 times compared to direct Ethereum use, addressing cost bottlenecks efficiently.},

SGs can also enhance the efficiency and reliability of electricity supplies and promote the integration of renewable energy sources. Smart Meters (SMs) are often seen as the first step to a successful implementation of SGs. While SMs enable Utility Providers and consumers to obtain near real-time information of energy consumption, they can also be exploited to infer sensitive consumer data. Therefore, privacy preservation in SMs is paramount in ensuring the widespread and successful deployment of SGs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art SM privacy-preserving techniques published in the literature over the past decade. We categorize these techniques based on the attack types and their objectives. We aim to offer a unique perspective in this survey article through the lens of privacy preservation, cross-cutting the wide range of techniques presented in the literature. We conclude by identifying the challenges and highlighting key future research directions in the field.},

However, besides complicating scalability due to verifier complexity, this assumption regarding the verifier’s trustworthiness renders existing CFA schemes prone to privacy breaches and implementation disclosure attacks under “honest-but-curious” adversaries. Thus, to suppress sensitive details from the verifier, we propose to have the prover outsource the verification of the attested execution path to an intermediate worker of which the verifier only learns the result. However, since a worker might be dishonest about the outcome of the verification, we propose a purely cryptographical solution of transforming the verification of the attested execution path into a verifiable computational task that can be reliably outsourced to a worker without relying on any trusted execution environment. Specifically, we propose to express a program-agnostic execution path verification task inside an arithmetic circuit whose correct execution can be verified by untrusted verifiers in zero knowledge.},

	abstract = {In this article, we tackle for the first time the problem of dynamic memory-efficient Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE). In the term “memory-efficient” SSE, we encompass both the goals of local SSE, and page-efficient SSE. The centerpiece of our approach is a novel connection between those two goals. We introduce a map, called the Generic Local Transform, which takes as input a page-efficient SSE scheme with certain special features, and outputs an SSE scheme with strong locality properties. We obtain several results. (1) First, for page-efficient SSE with page size p, we build a dynamic scheme with storage efficiency \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(\{1\})\$\$O(1)and page efficiency \$\${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\}{\textbackslash}left( \{{\textbackslash}textrm\{log\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}textrm\{log\}{\textbackslash}, (N/p)\}{\textbackslash}right) \$\$O{\textasciitilde}loglog(N/p), called \$\${\textbackslash}textsf\{LayeredSSE\}\$\$LayeredSSE. The main technical innovation behind \$\${\textbackslash}textsf\{LayeredSSE\}\$\$LayeredSSEis a novel weighted extension of the two-choice allocation process, of independent interest. (2) Second, we introduce the Generic Local Transform, and combine it with \$\${\textbackslash}textsf\{LayeredSSE\}\$\$LayeredSSEto build a dynamic SSE scheme with storage efficiency \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(\{1\})\$\$O(1), locality \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(\{1\})\$\$O(1), and read efficiency \$\${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}\}{\textbackslash}left( \{{\textbackslash}textrm\{log\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}textrm\{log\}{\textbackslash}, N\}{\textbackslash}right) \$\$O{\textasciitilde}loglogN, under the condition that the longest list is of size \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(\{N{\textasciicircum}\{1-1/{\textbackslash}textrm\{log\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}textrm\{log\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}lambda \}\})\$\$O(N1-1/loglogλ). This matches, in every respect, the purely static construction of Asharov et al. presented at STOC 2016: dynamism comes at no extra cost. (3) Finally, by applying the Generic Local Transform to a variant of the Tethys scheme by Bossuat et al. from Crypto 2021, we build an unconditional static SSE with storage efficiency \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(\{1\})\$\$O(1), locality \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(\{1\})\$\$O(1), and read efficiency \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{log\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}varepsilon N\})\$\$O(logεN), for an arbitrarily small constant \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textgreater} 0\$\$ε{\textgreater}0.

It turns out that the cause for the error is due to an essential oversight in the interaction between the different oracles used in the indifferentiability proofs. In essence, it reduces the claim from the normal indifferentiability setting to the weaker sequential indifferentiability one. As a matter of fact, this error appeared in multiple earlier indifferentiability papers, including the optimal indifferentiability of the sum of permutations (EUROCRYPT 2018) and the recent \$\${\textbackslash}textrm\{ABR\}{\textasciicircum}+\$\$ABR+construction (EUROCRYPT 2021).

We call this new security notion and any (tweakable) cipher that satisfies it a rugged pseudorandom permutation (RPRP). Rugged pseudorandom permutations lend themselves to some interesting applications, have practical benefits, and lead to novel cryptographic constructions. Our focus is on variable-length tweakable RPRPs, and analogous to the encode-then-encipher paradigm of Bellare and Rogaway, we can generically transform any such cipher into different AEAD schemes with varying security properties. However, the benefit of RPRPs is that they can be constructed more efficiently as they are weaker primitives than SPRPs (the notion traditionally required by the encode-then-encipher paradigm). We can construct RPRPs using only two layers of processing, whereas SPRPs typically require three layers of processing over the input data. We also identify a new transformation that yields RUP-secure AEAD schemes with more compact ciphertexts than previously known. Further extending this approach, we arrive at a new generalized notion of authenticated encryption and a matching construction, which we refer to as nonce-set AEAD. Nonce-set AEAD is particularly well-suited in the context of secure channels, like QUIC and DTLS, that operate over unreliable transports and employ a window mechanism at the receiver’s end of the channel. We conclude by presenting a generic construction for transforming a nonce-set AEAD scheme into an order-resilient secure channel. Our channel construction sheds new light on order-resilient channels and additionally leads to more compact ciphertexts when instantiated from RPRPs.},

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have emerged as a solution to this problem. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework that combines Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge (zk-STARKs) and Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) to deliver an efficient, scalable, quantum-resistant, and privacy-preserving ZKP system. The framework employs zk-STARKs' ability to handle large computations with quantum resistance and zk-SNARKs' succinct proofs and fast verification. The hybrid framework utilizes advanced arithmetization techniques to balance scalability, privacy, and security, including Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR) for zk-STARKs and Rank-1 Constraint Systems (RlCS) or PLONKish constraints for zk-SNARKs. The framework uses the Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg (KZG) polynomial commitment scheme for reliability and transparency and eliminates trusted setup by using Discrete-logarithm-based Argument of Recursive Knowledge (DARK) commitments and Poseidon hashing. This paper details the construction of the hybrid proof system, analyzes its complexity, and explores its potential applications. The framework solves smart contract data feed limitations, security, efficiency, and scalability while prioritizing privacy.},

In this paper, we show that even without a priori knowledge of household activities or prior training, it is possible to extract complex usage patterns from smart meter data using off-the-shelf statistical methods. Our analysis uses two months of data from three homes, which we instrumented to log aggregate household power consumption every second. With the data from our small-scale deployment, we demonstrate the potential for power consumption patterns to reveal a range of information, such as how many people are in the home, sleeping routines, eating routines, etc. We then sketch out the design of a privacy-enhancing smart meter architecture that allows an electric utility to achieve its net metering goals without compromising the privacy of its customers.},

	abstract = {The production of renewable energies by individual households typically is small-scale and not profitable without public subsidies, yet a critical factor in preventing further global warming. Unlike market-based peer-to-peer trading solutions, which require households to engage in costly peer-to-peer trading activities, we propose a community-based approach where households in a local distribution grid share the energy they produce in a netting process to maximize internal consumption. The technical instantiation of this idea in real-world energy grids comes with several challenges. Households within a community do not necessarily trust each other or electric utilities. Furthermore, energy consumption data is highly sensitive and must be protected. Further idiosyncrasies of national energy markets, regulatory frameworks, and current grid infrastructure exist. Addressing all these challenges, we propose a blockchain-based system that leverages zero-knowledge off-chain computations to facilitate automated energy sharing within a community in a trustless and privacy-preserving way. We provide a proof- of-concept implementation using the ZoKrates framework for verifiable off-chain computations and the Ethereum Blockchain. To support our claims, we provide evaluation results obtained in the context of a major German national research project on blockchain-based energy networks.},

Furthermore, the requirement to publish all corporate or individual information for processing at every node, essentially making the data public, is - despite of all other advantages - often considered a major obstacle to blockchain adoption. In this paper, we make two main contributions to address these two problems: (i) To increase efficiency, we propose a processing model which employs non-interactive proofs to off-chain computations, thereby reducing on-chain computational efforts to the verification of correctness of execution rather than the execution itself. Due to the verifiable computation scheme's zero-knowledge property, private information used in the off-chain computation does not have to become public to verify correctness. (ii) We introduce ZoKrates, a toolbox to specify, integrate and deploy such off-chain computations. It consists of a domain-specific language, a compiler, and generators for proofs and verification Smart Contracts. ZoKrates hides significant complexity inherent to zero-knowledge proofs, provides a more familiar and higher level of programming abstractions to developers and enables circuit integration, hence fostering adoption.},

Thus, in this paper, we propose a scalable second tier solution which combines the blockchain ledger with distributed queuing systems and NoSQL (Not Only SQL database) databases to allow the registration of energy transactions less frequently on the chain without losing the tamper-evident benefits brought by the blockchain technology. At the same time, we propose a technique for tamper-evident registration of smart meters’ energy data and associated energy transactions using digital fingerprinting which allows the energy transaction to be linked hashed-back on-chain, while the sensors data is stored off-chain. A prototype was implemented using Ethereum and smart contracts for the on-chain components while for the off-chain components we used Cassandra database and RabbitMQ messaging broker. The prototype proved to be effective in managing a settlement of energy imbalances use-case and during the evaluation conducted in simulated environment shows promising results in terms of scalability, throughput, and tampering of energy data sampled by smart energy meters.},

This work proposes a novel non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZKP) authentication protocol that incorporates the limiting factors in IoT communication devices and sensors. Our protocol considers the inherent network instability and replaces the ZKP NP-hard problem using the Merkle tree structure for the creation of the authentication challenge. A series of simulations evaluate the performance of NIZKP against traditional ZKP approaches based on graph isomorphism. A set of performance metrics has been used, namely the channel rounds for client authentication, effects of the authentication processes, and the protocol interactions to determine areas of improvements. The simulation results indicate empirical evidence for the suitability of our NIKP approach for authentication purposes in resource-constrained IoT environments.},

If the number of renewable electricity-producing/consuming facilities reached two million, an enormous number of transactions would be invoked beyond blockchain's scalability.We propose mutually cooperative two novel methods to simultaneously solve scalability, data size, and privacy problems in blockchain-based trading platforms for renewable energy environmental value. One is a management scheme of electricity production resources (EPRs) using an extended UTXO token.

However, using these services entails disclosing information by the customer, not only during the payment process but also when using the service, where certain personal information must be shared to obtain a more personalized service. This practice potentially exposes users to increased security risks in case of data security breaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at enhancing client privacy and ensuring service integrity within the context of computing services that rely on proprietary algorithms. A blockchain-based approach is proposed to enhance user privacy throughout service provision, encompassing both the payment process and the verification of the provided service. Our proposal leverages properties of distributed ledger networks to improve user privacy during payment transactions and incorporates a verification system using zero-knowledge proofs on blockchain to validate the integrity of the contracted service. Finally, we analyze the privacy, overhead, and performance aspects of the framework, employing custom proprietary algorithms. We illustrate this through examples of Convolutional Neural Networks with multiple layers, undisclosed to the client. This emphasizes the potential benefits of its applicability for both service providers and clients.},

However, the current approaches to data verification in blockchain systems, particularly in Ethereum, face challenges in terms of efficiency and computational overhead. The traditional use of Merkle Trees and cryptographic hash functions, while effective, leads to significant resource consumption, especially for large datasets. This highlights a gap in existing research: the need for more efficient methods of data verification in blockchain networks. Our study addresses this gap by proposing an innovative aggregation scheme for Zero-Knowledge Proofs within the structure of Merkle Trees. We develop a system that significantly reduces the size of the proof and the computational resources needed for its generation and verification. Our approach represents a paradigm shift in blockchain data verification, balancing security with efficiency. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations using real Ethereum block data to validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. The results demonstrate a drastic reduction in proof size and computational requirements compared to traditional methods, making the verification process more efficient and economically viable. Our contribution fills a critical research void, offering a scalable and secure solution for blockchain data verification.

However, the soaring resource consumption resulting from blockchain mining and DL model training has overwhelmed the extremely resource-constrained IoT. In this article, we first build a blockchain and DL-empowered cloud–edge orchestrated framework for an extremely resource-constrained IoT environment. To solve the resource bottleneck of this framework, we then propose a Zero-knowledge Proof of Learning (ZPoL) consensus approach to channel the meaningless Proof of Work (PoW) mining energy waste to valuable DL model training, while protecting the DL model privacy. Besides, to encourage resource-constrained IoT devices to perform meaningful DL model mining in our ZPoL consensus, we design a model quality-aware incentive mechanism based on a two-stage Stackelberg game. Moreover, we conduct extensive simulations and experiments to evaluate our proposed ZPoL-based framework. The numerical simulation illustrates that our proposed incentive mechanism could motivate IoT devices to actively join in DL model mining. Compared with the existing blockchain and DL-enabled IoT system, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ZPoL-based framework could significantly reduce the communication, computation, and storage cost, which is more applicable to a resource-constrained IoT environment.},

Therefore, authentication is a necessary tool to ensure the legitimacy of nodes and protect data security. Naturally, the authentication factors always include various sensitive users’ information, such as passwords, ID cards, even biological information, etc. How to prevent privacy leakage has always been a problem faced by the IoT. Zero-knowledge authentication is a crucial cryptographic technology that uses authenticates nodes on the networks without revealing identity or any other data entered by users. However, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) requires more complex data exchange protocols and more data transmission compared to traditional cryptography technologies. To understand how zero-knowledge authentication works in IoT, we produce a survey on zero-knowledge authentication in privacy-preserving IoT in the paper. First, we overview the IoT architecture and privacy, including security challenges and open question in different IoT layers. Next, we overview zero-knowledge authentication and provide a comprehensive analysis of designing zero-knowledge authentication protocols in various IoT networks. We summarize the advantages of ZKP-based authentication in IoT. Finally, it summarizes the potential problems and future directions of ZKP in IoT.},

To enable privacy-preserving authentication, access control, and secure communication, the framework integrates blockchain technology with Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) and post-quantum cryptography. A hybrid Reinforcement-Lattice Blockchain KeyGen for quantum-resilient key generation, Deep Q-Network Multi-Factor Secure Key (DQN-MFSK) for dynamic selection of keys, and Zero-Knowledge Proof for privacy-preserving signatures are employed to achieve secure IoT settings. This architecture entails data privacy and confidentiality, auditability and traceability, and withstanding evolving threats, including potential threats in terms of quantum attacks. It then uses blockchain technology for recording unalterable data of identity and access management while Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) ensures authentication and verification without revealing sensitive information. By decentralizing identity management and enabling multi-factor authentication, QBC-ZKPAF provides robust security and privacy solutions for IoT networks. The experimental results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness with 98\% privacy preservation, 700 TPS throughput, 0.7 J energy consumption, 0.98 quantum resilience, and 96\% access control effectiveness, making it highly suitable for modern IoT and blockchain applications.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging network technology applied to provide various services in our daily life. Generally, IoT environments are composed of numerous heterogeneous devices with constrained resource. The limited capability of IoT devices makes it impractical to perform traditional security mechanisms, and thus IoT services are usually vulnerable to all kinds of security threats, such as impersonation and forgery attacks. Moreover, the inflexible protection provided by these security mechanisms leads to inefficiency because different services haves diverse requirements. To provide IoT services suitable security protection, Multi-graph Zero-knowledge-based Authentication System (M-ZAS), which is not only light-weight but also high-adaptive, is proposed. Compared to traditional authentication mechanisms as well as other Zero-knowledge-proof (ZKP) methods such as GMW-ZKP, M-ZAS provides higher performance and better security protection. In addition, M-ZAS has lower transmission overheads than GMW-ZKP does. Considering relevant contexts as parameters, M-ZAS provides adaptive protection to fulfill what users actually need. Experiment results show that M-ZAS is 3 times faster than GMW-ZKP and even 7 times than traditional authentication mechanisms in IoT devices. Also, M-ZAS reduces 3 times network traffic than GMW-ZKP. Thus, the proposed M-ZAS is the most practical authentication system in IoT environments.},

	abstract = {Data privacy has become a severe concern due to the substantial growth in data gathering and processing, driven by the widespread adoption of cloud computing and cryptocurrency. Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) has emerged as a promising cryptographic protocol for ensuring data privacy. However, ZKP suffers from high computational costs, making it excessively slow when implemented in software. To identify performance bottlenecks in the ZKP protocol, existing research has focused on CPU performance evaluation at the architecture level, considering factors such as execution time and memory consumption. Nevertheless, ZKP protocols have distinct memory and computing needs at each stage, these studies lack detailed CPU performance analyses necessary to improve ZKP performance and promote wider adoption.In this paper, we provide a comprehensive performance analysis of widely used ZKP libraries on CPUs. We perform four different analyses to characterize the CPU microarchitecture, memory, code, and scalability performance of the ZKP protocol on different CPUs. Our analysis reveals that the ZKP protocol performs differently on different CPUs, emphasizing the need for microarchitecture-specific analysis and optimizations. We evaluate loads and stores, last level cache (LLC) misses per kilo instructions (MPKI), and maximum memory bandwidth utilization of ZKP. We observe the proving stage consumes the highest memory bandwidth (25Gbps). We identify the functions that consume the most CPU time in each stage of the ZKP protocol and categorize each stage as compute, control-flow, or data-flow intensive. Also, we identify the proving stage as the most scalable with the potential to be sped up by parallel computation. These findings provide valuable insights for designing future ZKP accelerators, leading to more efficient and scalable ZKP implementations.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the zk-IoT framework, a novel approach to enhancing the security of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems through the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) on blockchain platforms. Our framework ensures the integrity of firmware execution and data processing in potentially compromised IoT devices. By leveraging the concept of ZKP, we establish a trust layer that facilitates secure, autonomous communication between IoT devices in environments where devices may not inherently trust each other. The framework includes zk-Devices, which utilize functional commitment to generate proofs for executed programs, and service contracts for encoding interaction logic among devices. It also utilizes a blockchain layer and a relayer as a ZKP storage and data communication protocol, respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that proof generation and verification take approximately 694 and 19 milliseconds in our system setup, respectively. These timings meet the practical requirements for IoT device communication, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of our solution. The zk-IoT framework represents a significant advancement in the realm of IoT security, paving the way for reliable and scalable IoT networks across various applications, such as smart city infrastructures, healthcare systems, and industrial automation.},

	abstract = {Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) is a practical zero-knowledge proof system for Rank-1 Constraint Satisfaction (R1CS), enabling privacy preservation and addressing the previous scalability concerns on zero-knowledge proofs. Existing constructions of zkSNARKs require huge memory overhead to generate proofs in that the size of the zk-SNARK circuit can be large even for a very simple use case, which limits the applications for regular resource-constrained users. To reduce the memory utilization of zk-SNARKs, this paper presents a hash-based method “Split”. Concretely, Split intends to partition the zk-SNARK circuits so that components can be processed sequentially while ensuring strong security properties leveraging hash circuits. As a zkSNARK circuit is partitioned, obsolete variables are no longer preserved in the memory. We further propose an enhanced Split as n-Split, which leads to better optimization by properly choosing multiple splits. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of Split in conserving memory usage for resource-constrained provers as long as the circuit can be partitioned to a Good Split, indicating that via Split zk-SNARKs can be brought one step closer to practical applications.},

	abstract = {Today, Internet of Things (IoT) devices mostly operate in enclosed, proprietary environments. To unfold the full potential of IoT applications, a unifying and permissionless environment is crucial. All IoT devices, even unknown to each other, would be able to trade services and assets across various domains. In order to realize those applications, uniquely resolvable identities are essential. However, quantifiable trust in identities and their authentication are not trivially provided in such an environment due to the absence of a trusted authority. This research presents a new identity and trust framework for IoT devices, based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). IoT devices assign identities to themselves, which are managed publicly and decentralized on the DLT's network as Self Sovereign Identities (SSI). In addition to the Identity Management System (IdMS), the framework provides a Web of Trust (WoT) approach to enable automatic trust rating of arbitrary identities. For the framework we used the IOTA Tangle to access and store data, achieving high scalability and low computational overhead. To demonstrate the feasibility of our framework, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation and evaluate the set objectives for real world applicability as well as the vulnerability against common threats in IdMSs and WoTs.},

Digital identities have traditionally been used as a way of authenticating to the computer systems at work, or a personal online service, such as an email. Today, our physical existence has a digital counterpart that became an integral part of everyday life. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is the next step in the evolution of the digital identity management systems. The blockchain technology and distributed ledgers have provided necessary building blocks and facilities, that bring us closer to the realisation of an ideal Self-Sovereign Identity. But what exactly is an ideal Self-Sovereign Identity? What are the characteristics? Trade-oﬀs? Here, we propose the framework and methodology that can be used to evaluate, describe, and compare SSI systems.

	abstract = {In Self-Sovereign Identity: Decentralized digital identity and verifiable credentials, you’ll learn how SSI empowers us to receive digitally-signed credentials, store them in private wallets, and securely prove our online identities.Summary In a world of changing privacy regulations, identity theft, and online anonymity, identity is a precious and complex concept. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a set of technologies that move control of digital identity from third party “identity providers” directly to individuals, and it promises to be one of the most important trends for the coming decades. Personal data experts Drummond Reed and Alex Preukschat lay out a roadmap for a future of personal sovereignty powered by the Blockchain and cryptography. Cutting through technical jargon with dozens of practical cases, it presents a clear and compelling argument for why SSI is a paradigm shift, and how you can be ready to be prepared for it.  About the technology Trust on the internet is at an all-time low. Large corporations and institutions control our personal data because we’ve never had a simple, safe, strong way to prove who we are online. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) changes all that.  About the book In Self-Sovereign Identity: Decentralized digital identity and verifiable credentials, you’ll learn how SSI empowers us to receive digitally-signed credentials, store them in private wallets, and securely prove our online identities. It combines a clear, jargon-free introduction to this blockchain-inspired paradigm shift with interesting essays written by its leading practitioners. Whether for property transfer, ebanking, frictionless travel, or personalized services, the SSI model for digital trust will reshape our collective future.

	abstract = {Digital identity is the key to the evolving digital society and economy. Since the inception of digital identity, numerous Identity Management (IDM) systems have been developed to manage digital identity depending on the requirements of the individual and that of organisations. This evolution of IDM systems has provided an incremental process leading to the granting of control of identity ownership and personal data to its user, thus producing an IDM which is more user-centric with enhanced security and privacy. A recently promising IDM known as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has the potential to provide this sovereignty to the identity owner. The Sovrin Network is an emerging SSI service utility enabling self-sovereign identity for all, therefore, its assessment has to be carefully considered with reference to its architecture, working, functionality, strengths and limitations. This paper presents an analysis of the Sovrin Network based on aforementioned features. Firstly, it presents the architecture and components of the Sovrin Network. Secondly, it illustrates the working of the Sovrin Network and performs a detailed analysis of its various functionalities and metrics. Finally, based on the detailed analysis, it presents the strengths and limitations of the Sovrin Network.},

Self-Sovereign Identity is enabled by the new development of blockchain technology. Through the trustless, decentralised database that is provided by a blockchain, classic Identity Management registration processes can be replaced. We start off by giving a simple overview of blockchain based SSI, introducing an architecture overview as well as relevant actors in such a system. We further distinguish two major approaches, namely the Identifier Registry Model and its extension the Claim Registry Model. Subsequently we discuss identifiers in such a system, presenting past research in the area and current approaches in SSI in the context of Zooko’s Triangle. As the user of an SSI has to be linked with his digital identifier we also discuss authentication solutions. Most central to the concept of an SSI are the verifiable claims that are presented to relying parties. Resources in the field are only loosely connected. We will provide a more coherent view of verifiable claims in regards to blockchain based SSI and clarify differences in the used terminology. Storage solutions for the verifiable claims, both on- and off-chain, are presented with their advantages and disadvantages.},

However, the solutions limit verifiers from expressing and verifying multiple conditions efficiently. This paper introduces zkSSI, which enables verifiers to ex-press complex requirements by combining multiple conditions using logical predicates and nested conditions. zkSSI utilizes zk-SNARKs to generate single or multiple zero-knowledge proofs, validating compliance with verifiers' requirements both on-chain and off-chain. Formal proofs are provided to show the privacy and security guarantees of zkSSI, and experimental results demonstrate its efficiency for both holders and verifiers, even when using consumer-grade hardware.},

	abstract = {To instill greater confidence in computations outsourced to the cloud, clients should be able to verify the correctness of the results returned. To this end, we introduce Pinocchio, a built system for efficiently verifying general computations while relying only on cryptographic assumptions. With Pinocchio, the client creates a public evaluation key to describe her computation; this setup is proportional to evaluating the computation once. The worker then evaluates the computation on a particular input and uses the evaluation key to produce a proof of correctness. The proof is only 288 bytes, regardless of the computation performed or the size of the IO. Anyone can check the proof using a public verification key.Crucially, our evaluation on seven applications demonstrates that Pinocchio is efficient in practice too. Pinocchio's verification time is a fixed 10 ms plus 0.4--15 μs per IO element: 5--7 orders of magnitude less than previous work; indeed Pinocchio is the first general-purpose system to demonstrate verification cheaper than native execution (for some apps). The worker's proof effort is still expensive, but Pinocchio reduces it by 19×--60× relative to prior work. As an additional feature, Pinocchio allows the worker to include private inputs in the computation and prove that she performed the computation correctly without revealing any information about the private inputs to the client. Finally, to aid development, Pinocchio provides an end-to-end toolchain that compiles a subset of C into programs that implement the verifiable computation protocol.\&lt;!-- END\_PAGE\_1 --\&gt;},

The designed protocol ensures minimal disclosure of information to a single trusted third party.

	abstract = {Frequently, users on the web need to show that they are, for example, not a robot, old enough to access an age restricted video, or eligible to download an ebook from their local public library without being tracked. Anonymous credentials were developed to address these concerns. However, existing schemes do not handle the realities of deployment or the complexities of real-world identity. Instead, they implicitly make assumptions such as there being an issuing authority for anonymous credentials that, for real applications, requires the local department of motor vehicles to issue sophisticated cryptographic tokens to show users are over 18. In reality, there are multiple trust sources for a given identity attribute, their credentials have distinctively different formats, and many, if not all, issuers are unwilling to adopt new protocols.We present and build zk-creds, a protocol that uses general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs to 1) remove the need for credential issuers to hold signing keys: credentials can be issued to a bulletin board instantiated as a transparency log, Byzantine system, or even a blockchain; 2) convert existing identity documents into anonymous credentials without modifying documents or coordinating with their issuing authority; 3) allow for flexible, composable, and complex identity statements over multiple credentials. Concretely, identity assertions using zk-creds take less than 150ms in a real-world scenario of using a passport to anonymously access age-restricted videos.},

The detailed information can be used to judge whether persons are in the household, when they come home, which electric devices they use (e.g. when they watch TV), and so forth. In this work, we introduce the "smart metering privacy model" for measuring the degree of privacy that a smart metering application can provide.

	abstract = {Understanding the emergence of data breaches is crucial for cyber insurance and risk management. However, analyses of data breach frequency trends in the current literature lead to contradictory conclusions. We put forward that those discrepancies may be (at least partially) due to inconsistent data collection standards, as well as reporting patterns, over time and space. We set out to carefully control both. In this article, we conduct a joint analysis of state attorneys general’s publications on data breaches across eight states (namely, California, Delaware, Indiana, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington), all of which are subject to established data collection standards; namely, state data breach (mandatory) notification laws. Thanks to our explicit recognition of these notification laws, we are capable of modeling frequency of breaches in a consistent and comparable way over time. Hence, we are able to isolate and capture the complexities of reporting patterns, adequately estimate incurred but not reported (IBNR) data breaches, and yield a highly reliable assessment of historical frequency trends in data breaches. Our analysis also provides a comprehensive comparison of data breach frequency across the eight U.S. states, extending knowledge on state-specific differences in cyber risk, which has not been extensively discussed in the current literature. We thus illustrate how each state’s unique regulations, market dynamics, demographic profiles, and risk factors can significantly impact insurance products and pricing. Furthermore, we uncover novel features not previously discussed in the literature, such as differences in cyber risk frequency trends between large and small data breaches (i.e., breaches affecting more or fewer state residents), due to differences in state definitions of reportable data breaches. Overall, we find that the reporting delays are lengthening. We also elicit commonalities and heterogeneities in reporting patterns across states, severity levels, and time periods. After adequately estimating IBNRs, we find that frequency is relatively stable before 2020 and increasing after 2020. This is consistent across states. Implications of our findings for cyber insurance reserving, pricing, underwriting, and experience monitoring are discussed.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00823},
	abstract = {Today, digital identity management for individuals is either inconvenient and error-prone or creates undesirable lock-in effects and violates privacy and security expectations. These shortcomings inhibit the digital transformation in general and seem particularly concerning in the context of novel applications such as access control for decentralized autonomous organizations and identification in the Metaverse. Decentralized or self-sovereign identity (SSI) aims to offer a solution to this dilemma by empowering individuals to manage their digital identity through machine-verifiable attestations stored in a "digital wallet" application on their edge devices. However, when presented to a relying party, these attestations typically reveal more attributes than required and allow tracking end users' activities. Several academic works and practical solutions exist to reduce or avoid such excessive information disclosure, from simple selective disclosure to data-minimizing anonymous credentials based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). We first demonstrate that the SSI solutions that are currently built with anonymous credentials still lack essential features such as scalable revocation, certificate chaining, and integration with secure elements. We then argue that general-purpose ZKPs in the form of zk-SNARKs can appropriately address these pressing challenges. We describe our implementation and conduct performance tests on different edge devices to illustrate that the performance of zk-SNARK-based anonymous credentials is already practical. We also discuss further advantages that general-purpose ZKPs can easily provide for digital wallets, for instance, to create "designated verifier presentations" that facilitate new design options for digital identity infrastructures that previously were not accessible because of the threat of man-in-the-middle attacks.},

	abstract = {The amount of sensitive information that service providers handle about their users has become a concerning fact in many use cases, where users have no other option but to trust that those companies will not misuse their personal information. To solve that, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems have become a hot topic of research in recent years: SSI systems allow users to manage their identities transparently. Recent solutions represent the rights of users to use services as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) stored on Blockchains, and users prove possession of these rights using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). However, even when ZKPs do not leak any information about the rights, the NFTs are stored as public values linked to known accounts, and thus, they can be traced. In this paper, we design a native privacy-preserving NFT model for the Dusk Network Blockchain, and on top of it, we deploy Citadel: our novel full-privacy-preserving SSI system, where the rights of the users are privately stored on the Dusk Network Blockchain, and users can prove their ownership in a fully private manner.},

	abstract = {Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic primitives allowing a party to prove to another party that the former knows some information while keeping it secret. Such a premise can lead to the development of numerous privacy-preserving protocols in different scenarios, like proving knowledge of some credentials to a server without leaking the identity of the user. Even when the applications of ZKPs were endless, they were not exploited in the wild for a couple of decades due to the fact that computing and verifying proofs was too computationally expensive. However, the advent of efficient schemes (in particular, zk-SNARKs) made this primitive to break into the scene in fields like cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts, and more recently, self-sovereign scenarios: private-by-design identity management and authentication. Nevertheless, its adoption in environments like the Internet of Things (IoT) remains unexplored due to the computational limitations of embedded systems. In this paper, we introduce ZPiE, a C library intended to create ZKP applications to be executed in embedded systems. Its main feature is portability: it can be compiled, executed, and used out-of-the-box in a wide variety of devices. Moreover, our proof-of-concept has been proved to work smoothly in different devices with limited resources, which can execute state-of-the-art ZKP authentication protocols.},

	abstract = {The recent surge in artificial intelligence (AI), characterized by the prominence of large language models (LLMs), has ushered in fundamental transformations across the globe. However, alongside these advancements, concerns surrounding the legitimacy of LLMs have grown, posing legal challenges to their extensive applications. Compounding these concerns, the parameters of LLMs are often treated as intellectual property, restricting direct investigations. In this study, we address a fundamental challenge within the realm of AI legislation: the need to establish the authenticity of outputs generated by LLMs. To tackle this issue, we present zkLLM, which stands as the inaugural specialized zero-knowledge proof tailored for LLMs to the best of our knowledge. Addressing the persistent challenge of non-arithmetic operations in deep learning, we introduce tlookup, a parallelized lookup argument designed for non-arithmetic tensor operations in deep learning, offering a solution with no asymptotic overhead. Furthermore, leveraging the foundation of tlookup, we introduce zkAttn, a specialized zero-knowledge proof crafted for the attention mechanism, carefully balancing considerations of running time, memory usage, and accuracy. Empowered by our fully parallelized CUDA implementation, zkLLM emerges as a significant stride towards achieving efficient zero-knowledge verifiable computations over LLMs. Remarkably, for LLMs boasting 13 billion parameters, our approach enables the generation of a correctness proof for the entire inference process in under 15 minutes. The resulting proof, compactly sized at less than 200 kB, is designed to uphold the privacy of the model parameters, ensuring no inadvertent information leakage.},

	abstract = {As IoT becomes omnipresent vast amounts of data are generated, which can be used for building innovative applications. However,interoperability issues and security concerns, prevent harvesting the full potentials of these data. In this paper we consider the use case of data generated by smart buildings. Buildings are becoming ever "smarter" by integrating IoT devices that improve comfort through sensing and automation. However, these devices and their data are usually siloed in specific applications or manufacturers, even though they can be valuable for various interested stakeholders who provide different types of "over the top" services, e.g., energy management. Most data sharing techniques follow an "all or nothing" approach, creating significant security and privacy threats, when even partially revealed, privacy-preserving, data subsets can fuel innovative applications. With these in mind we develop a platform that enables controlled, privacy-preserving sharing of data items. Our system innovates in two directions: Firstly, it provides a framework for allowing discovery and selective disclosure of IoT data without violating their integrity. Secondly, it provides a user-friendly, intuitive mechanisms allowing efficient, fine-grained access control over the shared data. Our solution leverages recent advances in the areas of Self-Sovereign Identities, Verifiable Credentials, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and it integrates them in a platform that combines the industry-standard authorization framework OAuth 2.0 and the Web of Things specifications.},

To this end, we benchmarked three SNARK proving systems and five ZK-friendly hash functions, including our self-developed circuit templates for Poseidon2, Neptune, and GMiMC, on the bn254 curve within the circom-snarkjs framework. We also introduced the role of "sequencer" in our SNARK-based privacy-preserving transaction scheme to enhance efficiency and enable flexible auditing. We conducted privacy and security analyses, as well as implementation and evaluation on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains. The results indicate that Poseidon and Poseidon2 demonstrate superior memory usage and runtime during proof generation under Groth16. Moreover, compared to the baseline, Poseidon2 not only generates proofs faster but also reduces on-chain costs by 73\% on EVM chains and nearly 26\% on Hedera. Our work provides a benchmark for ZK-friendly hash functions and ZK tools, while also exploring cost efficiency and compliance in ZKP-based privacy-preserving transaction protocols.},

	abstract = {Reducing peak demand in distribution grids is associated with benefits such as delayed infrastructural investments, decreased losses and a reduced risk of power deficits. One instrument aimed at reducing peak demand is the demand charge, a capacity-based component in a network tariff that intends to encourage users to reduce their peak usage. Using ten years of data from a Swedish distribution network, this study demonstrates that demand charges may be unsuitable for managing the problems they are intended to address. Two critical misalignments in the design of these demand charges are identified: 1) Demand charges are most commonly based on maximum billing demand – a given user's maximum monthly peak – whereas the problem of peak demand overwhelmingly concerns maximum system peaks in the distribution grid as a whole. The lack of coincidence between these peaks suggest that demand charges are, by design, ineffective for reducing peak demand. 2) The peaks which determine a distribution system's maximum capacity requirements are rare, seasonal and largely temperature-driven events, whereas demand charges mainly target users' habitual daily patterns, encouraging daily shifts from peak to off-peak hours. As long as the main driver of network costs, maximum system peaks, are absent in their design, demand charges will neither reflect the costs that users impose on the grid nor provide them with the correct price signals on how to best act.},

	abstract = {Verifiable decentralized federated learning (FL) systems combining blockchains and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) make the computational integrity of local learning and global aggregation verifiable across workers. However, they are not end-to-end: data can still be corrupted prior to the learning. In this paper, we propose a verifiable decentralized FL system for end-to-end integrity and authenticity of data and computation extending verifiability to the data source. Addressing an inherent conflict of confidentiality and transparency, we introduce a two-step proving and verification (2PV) method that we apply to central system procedures: a registration workflow that enables non-disclosing verification of device certificates and a learning workflow that extends existing blockchain and ZKP-based FL systems through non-disclosing data authenticity proofs. Our evaluation on a prototypical implementation demonstrates the technical feasibility with only marginal overheads to state-of-the-art solutions.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), particularly Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs), benchmarking various ZK tools has become a valuable task. ZK-friendly hash functions, as key algorithms in blockchain, have garnered significant attention. Therefore, comprehensive benchmarking and evaluations of these evolving algorithms in ZK circuits present both promising opportunities and challenges. Additionally, we focus on a popular ZKP application, privacy-preserving transaction protocols, aiming to leverage SNARKs' cost-efficiency through "batch processing" to address high on-chain costs and compliance issues. To this end, we benchmarked three SNARK proving systems and five ZK-friendly hash functions, including our self-developed circuit templates for Poseidon2, Neptune, and GMiMC, on the bn254 curve within the circom-snarkjs framework. We also introduced the role of "sequencer" in our SNARK-based privacy-preserving transaction scheme to enhance efficiency and enable flexible auditing. We conducted privacy and security analyses, as well as implementation and evaluation on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible chains. The results indicate that Poseidon and Poseidon2 demonstrate superior memory usage and runtime during proof generation under Groth16. Moreover, compared to the baseline, Poseidon2 not only generates proofs faster but also reduces on-chain costs by 73\% on EVM chains and nearly 26\% on Hedera. Our work provides a benchmark for ZK-friendly hash functions and ZK tools, while also exploring cost efficiency and compliance in ZKP-based privacy-preserving transaction protocols.},

To address this, we present HashEmAll, a novel collection of FPGA-based realizations of three ZK-friendly hash functions: Griffin, Rescue-Prime, and Reinforced Concrete. Each hash offers different optimization focuses, allowing users to choose based on the constraints of their applications.

	abstract = {As IoT becomes omnipresent vast amounts of data are generated, which can be used for building innovative applications. However,interoperability issues and security concerns, prevent harvesting the full potentials of these data. In this paper we consider the use case of data generated by smart buildings. Buildings are becoming ever "smarter" by integrating IoT devices that improve comfort through sensing and automation. However, these devices and their data are usually siloed in specific applications or manufacturers, even though they can be valuable for various interested stakeholders who provide different types of "over the top" services, e.g., energy management. Most data sharing techniques follow an "all or nothing" approach, creating significant security and privacy threats, when even partially revealed, privacy-preserving, data subsets can fuel innovative applications. With these in mind we develop a platform that enables controlled, privacy-preserving sharing of data items. Our system innovates in two directions: Firstly, it provides a framework for allowing discovery and selective disclosure of IoT data without violating their integrity. Secondly, it provides a user-friendly, intuitive mechanisms allowing efficient, fine-grained access control over the shared data. Our solution leverages recent advances in the areas of Self-Sovereign Identities, Verifiable Credentials, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and it integrates them in a platform that combines the industry-standard authorization framework OAuth 2.0 and the Web of Things specifications.},

	abstract = {The recent surge in artificial intelligence (AI), characterized by the prominence of large language models (LLMs), has ushered in fundamental transformations across the globe. However, alongside these advancements, concerns surrounding the legitimacy of LLMs have grown, posing legal challenges to their extensive applications. Compounding these concerns, the parameters of LLMs are often treated as intellectual property, restricting direct investigations. In this study, we address a fundamental challenge within the realm of AI legislation: the need to establish the authenticity of outputs generated by LLMs. To tackle this issue, we present zkLLM, which stands as the inaugural specialized zero-knowledge proof tailored for LLMs to the best of our knowledge. Addressing the persistent challenge of non-arithmetic operations in deep learning, we introduce tlookup, a parallelized lookup argument designed for non-arithmetic tensor operations in deep learning, offering a solution with no asymptotic overhead. Furthermore, leveraging the foundation of tlookup, we introduce zkAttn, a specialized zero-knowledge proof crafted for the attention mechanism, carefully balancing considerations of running time, memory usage, and accuracy. Empowered by our fully parallelized CUDA implementation, zkLLM emerges as a significant stride towards achieving efficient zero-knowledge verifiable computations over LLMs. Remarkably, for LLMs boasting 13 billion parameters, our approach enables the generation of a correctness proof for the entire inference process in under 15 minutes. The resulting proof, compactly sized at less than 200 kB, is designed to uphold the privacy of the model parameters, ensuring no inadvertent information leakage.},

	abstract = {Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic primitives allowing a party to prove to another party that the former knows some information while keeping it secret. Such a premise can lead to the development of numerous privacy-preserving protocols in different scenarios, like proving knowledge of some credentials to a server without leaking the identity of the user. Even when the applications of ZKPs were endless, they were not exploited in the wild for a couple of decades due to the fact that computing and verifying proofs was too computationally expensive. However, the advent of efficient schemes (in particular, zk-SNARKs) made this primitive to break into the scene in fields like cryptocurrencies, smart-contracts, and more recently, self-sovereign scenarios: private-by-design identity management and authentication. Nevertheless, its adoption in environments like the Internet of Things (IoT) remains unexplored due to the computational limitations of embedded systems. In this paper, we introduce ZPiE, a C library intended to create ZKP applications to be executed in embedded systems. Its main feature is portability: it can be compiled, executed, and used out-of-the-box in a wide variety of devices. Moreover, our proof-of-concept has been proved to work smoothly in different devices with limited resources, which can execute state-of-the-art ZKP authentication protocols.},

To solve that, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) systems have become a hot topic of research in recent years: SSI systems allow users to manage their identities transparently. Recent solutions represent the rights of users to use services as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) stored on Blockchains, and users prove possession of these rights using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). However, even when ZKPs do not leak any information about the rights, the NFTs are stored as public values linked to known accounts, and thus, they can be traced. In this paper, we design a native privacy-preserving NFT model for the Dusk Network Blockchain, and on top of it, we deploy Citadel: our novel full-privacy-preserving SSI system, where the rights of the users are privately stored on the Dusk Network Blockchain, and users can prove their ownership in a fully private manner.},

	abstract = {Today, digital identity management for individuals is either inconvenient and error-prone or creates undesirable lock-in effects and violates privacy and security expectations. These shortcomings inhibit the digital transformation in general and seem particularly concerning in the context of novel applications such as access control for decentralized autonomous organizations and identification in the Metaverse. Decentralized or self-sovereign identity (SSI) aims to offer a solution to this dilemma by empowering individuals to manage their digital identity through machine-verifiable attestations stored in a "digital wallet" application on their edge devices. However, when presented to a relying party, these attestations typically reveal more attributes than required and allow tracking end users' activities. Several academic works and practical solutions exist to reduce or avoid such excessive information disclosure, from simple selective disclosure to data-minimizing anonymous credentials based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). We first demonstrate that the SSI solutions that are currently built with anonymous credentials still lack essential features such as scalable revocation, certificate chaining, and integration with secure elements. We then argue that general-purpose ZKPs in the form of zk-SNARKs can appropriately address these pressing challenges. We describe our implementation and conduct performance tests on different edge devices to illustrate that the performance of zk-SNARK-based anonymous credentials is already practical. We also discuss further advantages that general-purpose ZKPs can easily provide for digital wallets, for instance, to create "designated verifier presentations" that facilitate new design options for digital identity infrastructures that previously were not accessible because of the threat of man-in-the-middle attacks.},
