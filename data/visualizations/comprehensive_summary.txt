## Recommendations

### For Real-Time Applications (< 1 second latency)
✅ Use Standard SNARKs for immediate response requirements
⚠️  Consider hybrid approach for mixed workloads

### For Batch Processing (> 1000 data points)  
✅ Use Recursive SNARKs for optimal efficiency
✅ Implement batch sizes ≥ 20 for maximum benefit

### For Resource-Limited IoT Devices
✅ Recursive SNARKs recommended for memory-constrained environments
✅ Consider power consumption trade-offs (20% improvement typical)

### For Long-Term Data Processing
✅ Recursive SNARKs essential for monthly/yearly datasets
✅ Implement progressive batching strategies

## Conclusion

This evaluation demonstrates clear advantages for Recursive SNARKs in IoT environments,
particularly for larger datasets and resource-constrained devices. The optimal choice
depends on specific requirements:

- **Data Size**: >1000 points favor Recursive SNARKs
- **Latency Requirements**: <100ms favor Standard SNARKs  
- **Device Resources**: Limited memory/power favor Recursive SNARKs
- **Processing Pattern**: Batch processing favors Recursive SNARKs

The threshold analysis provides clear guidelines for implementation decisions,
enabling optimal ZK-SNARK system selection based on specific IoT deployment requirements.
